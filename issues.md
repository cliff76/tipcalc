## Issues

### January 18, 2017

Onchange is working. 3 issues addressed today:
- Added .vaule on the end of the var declaration fo split
- Entering nothing in the bill field don't give me the updated innerHTML, however, entering a 0 will trigger the update.
- The spilt would not calculate. I had a variable from the scripts.js file that was copied over, but not delclared or needed. 

## I would like to get localstorage or session storage to keep the total bill from index.html and add it to the bill field on the split.html page.

Getting closer. Onchange is the key.
Now to get the value into the variable.

I can't figure out how to get the check to split.
It never gets pass the 2nd line of the function.
The error is.

split.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null
